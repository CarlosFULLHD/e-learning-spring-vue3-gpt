### `Resources`

Additional resources linked to courses.

- `id_resource`: Unique identifier for the resource.
- `id_subject`: Foreign key to the associated subject.
- `resource_type`: The type of resource (e.g., 'book', 'article', 'video').
- `resource_name`: The name of the resource.
- `resource_link`: URL to the resource.
- `resource_img`: URL to an image representing the resource.

### `Enrollments`

Enrollments of users in subjects/courses.

- `id_enrollment`: Unique identifier for the enrollment.
- `id_user`: Foreign key to the associated user.
- `id_subject`: Foreign key to the associated subject.
- `enrollment_date`: The date of enrollment.

### `ChatInteractions`

Record of user interactions with Chat GPT.

- `id_chat_interaction`: Unique identifier for the interaction.
- `id_user`: Foreign key to the associated user.
- `interaction_time`: Timestamp of the interaction.
- `user_question`: The question asked by the user.
- `gpt_response`: The response generated by Chat GPT.

### `Assessments`

Evaluations or tests linked to lessons.

- `id_assessment`: Unique identifier for the assessment.

- `assessment_description`: Description of the assessment.

### `AssessmentResults`

- `id_user`: Foreign key to the associated user.
- `score`: The score obtained by the user.
- `assessment_date`: The date when the assessment was taken.

### `Feedback`

Feedback from users about lessons.

- `id_feedback`: Unique identifier for the feedback.
- `id_lesson`: Foreign key to the associated lesson.
- `id_user`: Foreign key to the associated user.
- `feedback_text`: The text of the feedback.
- `feedback_date`: The date when the feedback was given.

## Database Relationships

- Users can enroll in multiple subjects.
- Subjects can contain multiple modules.
- Modules can contain multiple lessons.
- Subjects can have multiple resources associated with them.
- Users can interact with Chat GPT multiple times and about different lessons.
- Lessons can have multiple assessments.
- Users can have multiple assessment results.
- Lessons can receive multiple feedback entries from different users.

## Integration with Chat GPT

The `ChatInteractions` table is designed to store the conversation logs between the user and Chat GPT. When implementing the backend logic, make sure to capture the `interaction_time`, `user_question`, and `gpt_response` accurately to provide a seamless user experience.

## Security Considerations

Ensure that all interactions with the database, especially those involving user information and passwords, are handled securely. Use hashing for passwords and implement proper access controls for different user roles.
